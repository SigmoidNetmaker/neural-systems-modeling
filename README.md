This repository contains MATLAB code for all the computational neuroscience models presented in the book:  
Anastasio TJ (2010) Tutorial on Neural Systems Modeling, Sinauer Associates

All of the code (MATLAB mfiles) is extensively commented and was written to be easily followed. Step-by-step instructions for using the code, along with the mathimatical basis of the models and their neurobiological implications, are presented in the book, to which the user of this repository is referred for details.    

The book is organized into 14 chapters, each with its own set of mfiles. The book chapters and the mfiles to which they belong are listed below.
