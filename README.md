# neural-systems-modeling
This repository contains MATLAB code for all the computational neuroscience models presented in the book:  
Anastasio TJ (2010) Tutorial on Neural Systems Modeling, Sinauer Associates

All of the code (MATLAB mfiles) is extensively commented and was written to be easily followed. Step-by-step instructions for using the code, along with the mathimatical basis of the models and their neurobiological implications, are presented in the book, to which the user of this repository is referred for details.    

The book is organized into 14 chapters, each with its own set of mfiles. The names of most of the mfiles begin with two letters that signify the chapter to which they belong. Mfile names in all caps signify mfiles that are printed out and described in detail in the book. Mfile names that depart from those conventions are ancillary. The book chapters and the mfiles to which they belong are listed below.
